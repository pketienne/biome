  This is a block scalar that spans multiple lines
  and preserves newlines exactly as written.

  It can contain blank lines too.
  Very useful for multi-line text content.

summary: >
  This is a folded scalar that wraps
  into a single paragraph. Line breaks
  become spaces unless followed by
  a blank line.

  This starts a new paragraph.
