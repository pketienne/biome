# Multiline strings
multiline:
  literal_block: |
    This is a literal block scalar.
    It preserves newlines exactly.

    Including blank lines.
    And trailing content.
  folded_block: >
    This is a folded block scalar.
    It folds newlines into spaces.

    But preserves blank lines
    as paragraph separators.
  literal_strip: |-
    No trailing newline
    after this block
  literal_keep: |+
    Keeps trailing
    newlines


  folded_strip: >-
    No trailing newline
    after this fold
  plain_multiline: this is a plain
    scalar that spans
    multiple lines
